# EDGE_Project_Sazzadul_Islam_Shuvo_2108057

## 📘 Project Name  
**Train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Regression**

---

## 🧠 Overview  
This project demonstrates how to train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for **regression tasks** using MATLAB.  
Instead of typical classification, the network is designed to predict continuous numerical outputs based on image data.  

---

## 🚀 Key Features  
- Implementation of a CNN architecture for **regression** instead of classification  
- Data visualization of training images and progress  
- Performance monitoring using MATLAB’s built-in training tools  
- Visual output of **training progress** and **network testing results**
